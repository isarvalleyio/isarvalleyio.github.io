We don’t have our own TV show, yet. Munich has always been a very electrifying city. In the 80s even world class celibrities like Freddy Mercurry lived here. Two of the world’s top 100 universities are located in Munich as well as world leading companies like Siemens or BMW - making the city one of the biggest IT hubs worldwide. By the way, the name Isar Valley is not just a cheap copy of the name Silicon Valley - it’s simply the English translation of the word „Isartal“, which is the valley where Munich is located.

This blog is trying to build a platform for the developer community here in Munich. We will provide you with all the buzz our tech scene has to offer, interesting interviews and portraits of startups and corporations which have found their home in the beautiful Isar Valley. And who knows? Maybe Netflix (or the BR) wants to produce a Bavarian startup TV show as well…
